# embedez

This is a proxy for [EmbedEZ](https://embedez.com/), it utilizes EmbedEZ's API to provide the same embed as the original service, but removes the ads and redirects to the original source of the URL instead of EmbedEZ's page.

I consider this service to be unethical, as it interferes with the original content creator's monetization and ad revenue. If you want to support the EmbedEZ service, you can [buy a subscription on their website](https://embedez.com/premium).
