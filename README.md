# PROJECT ABANDONED

This project will no longer be maintained. Please use [Embed Fixer](https://github.com/seriaati/embed-fixer) and turn on "Show original link button" in settings.

# embedez

This is a proxy for [EmbedEZ](https://embedez.com/), it utilizes EmbedEZ's API to provide the same embed as the original service, but removes the ads and redirects to the original source of the URL instead of EmbedEZ's page.

I consider this service to be unethical, as it interferes with the original content creator's monetization and ad revenue. If you want to support EmbedEZ, you can [buy a subscription on their website](https://embedez.com/premium).

## Usage

<https://embedez.seria.moe/embed?url={URL}>

## Examples

- Instagram: <https://embedez.seria.moe/embed?url=https://instagram.com/p/DHpNga4RiOD/>
- Facebook Reels: <https://embedez.seria.moe/embed?url=https://www.facebookez.com/share/r/1HG7RTsybr/?mibextid=wwXIfr>

## Embed Fixer

This service is made for [Embed Fixer](https://github.com/seriaati/embed-fixer).

Since the way to use this fixer is quite troublesome (need to add a lot of texts), I recommend using the bot as it changes the URL for you.
